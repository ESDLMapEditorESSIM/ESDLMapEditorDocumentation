Removing assets
===============

Assets can be removed in multiple ways:

* Using the edit and remove controls (nr. 13 in :ref:`this picture<The ESDL MapEditor user interface>`):

  By clicking on the lower icon, you start the remove mode. All assets can then be removed by clicking them. The remove
  mode must be confirmed by pressing the 'save' button.

* By right clicking on an asset icon (or on the line) and selecting 'Delete' from the context menu
