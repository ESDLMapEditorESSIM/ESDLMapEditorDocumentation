Adding assets from the Energy Data Repository
=============================================

The `Energy Data Repository <https://edr.hesi.energy>`_ is an online database with ESDL data. The Energy Data Repository
(EDR) contains 3 sections:

* Assets: Asset data with technology and cost parameters
* Profiles: Standard profiles
* Key figures: Key figures, like a list of energy carriers, or the sector overview according to the `SBI
  <https://www.kvk.nl/overzicht-standaard-bedrijfsindeling/>`_

At the moment the MapEditor allows to add assets to the map based on the EDR contents. To add an assets from the EDR,
click the 'EDR assets' button:

The dialog contains two drop down lists. The first one can be used to filter on a specific type of asset. The second
drop down list actually determines which asset information is loaded from the EDR. Press the 'Select' button to start
with the process of adding the asset to a specific location. See the :ref:`Adding assets<Adding assets>` section for more information.
