The ESDL MapEditor is a map based editor for energy systems or energy transition scenarios. It is fully based on the
Energy System Description Language (ESDL).

It provides the following functionality:

* Draw an energy system scenario by dragging and dropping energy assets on a map
* Connect components, set typical component characteristics (installed power, efficiencies, costs)
* Attach power or energy profiles to assets (demand and production profiles)
* Set control strategies (specifically needed for ESSIM simulations)
* Query external ESDL data sources, for example for solar or wind potential
* Visualize WMS layers with information that can be used to define your scenario
* Convert shapefiles into ESDL assets
* Query the boundary service for area borders (provinces, municipalities)
* Visualize results of simulations on the map (KPI dashboards, load animations, color areas based on KPI outcomes, load duration curves)
