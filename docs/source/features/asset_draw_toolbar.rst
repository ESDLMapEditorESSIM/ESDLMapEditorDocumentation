Configuring the Asset Draw Toolbar
**********************************

In the application settings window, in the section 'AssetDrawToolbar plugin', subsection 'Standard assets' you can
determine which assets you want to appear in the toolbar. These settings depend on the view mode. The view mode can be
selected with the select box at the top of the configuration window. This allows you to have different assets visible
in the toolbar when you're drawing a detailed design of a district heat network, than when you're designing a more high
level energy system. In the below picture the view mode 'standard' has been selected. You can move assets from left to
right to let them appear in the toolbar and from right to left to let them disasppear.
